# @nejs/basic-extensions

## Overview

@nejs/basic-extensions is a JavaScript library that provides a collection of essential extensions
to built-in JavaScript objects like Array, Object, Function, and Reflect. These extensions are
designed to enhance the native capabilities of JavaScript objects, providing developers with
additional utility methods for common tasks and improving code readability and efficiency.

## Features

*   **Array Extensions**: Adds convenience methods to JavaScript arrays, like `first` and `last`,
    for easy access to the first and last elements.

*   **Object Extensions**: Introduces utility functions to the Object class, such as methods for
    checking object types and manipulating properties.

*   **Function Extensions**: Enriches the Function class with methods to identify function types,
    such as arrow functions, async functions, and bound functions.

*   **Reflect Extensions**: Extends the Reflect object with advanced property interaction methods,
    including checks for the presence of multiple or specific keys.

## Installation

### Deferred

**Extends Promise**

Deferreds, which were first introduced by jQuery for browsers in the early
2000s, are a way to manage asynchronous operations. They have been widely
used and replicated by engineers since then. Although the Promise class in
modern JavaScript provides a static method called `withResolvers` that
returns an object with similar properties to a Deferred, it is not directly
supported by Node.js.

    const withResolvers = Promise.withResolvers()
    Reflect.has(withResolvers, 'promise') // true
    Reflect.has(withResolvers, 'resolve') // true
    Reflect.has(withResolvers, 'reject')  // true

This Deferred class extends the Promise class, allowing it to capture the
value or reason for easy access after resolution, akin to
[Promise.withResolvers](Promise.withResolvers). As it extends [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise), it is
'thenable' and works with `await` as if it were a native Promise. This
allows seamless integration with code expecting Promise-like objects.

#### Parameters

*   `options` **[object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** see above for examples on supported options, but
    when supplied, the constructor can take instructions on how to auto
    resolve or reject the deferred created here.

#### value

When the Deferred is settled with [Deferred.resolve](Deferred.resolve), the `value`
passed to that function will be set here as well.

Type: any

#### reason

When the Deferred is settled with [Deferred.reject](Deferred.reject), the `reason`
passed to that rejection will also be stored here.

Type: any

#### settled

Returns a boolean value that indicates whether or not this Deferred
has been settled (either resolve or reject have been invoked).

Returns **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** `true` if either [Deferred.resolve](Deferred.resolve) or
[Deferred.reject](Deferred.reject) have been invoked; `false` otherwise

#### promise

Accessor for the promise managed by this Deferred instance.

This getter provides access to the internal promise which is controlled
by the Deferred's resolve and reject methods. It allows external code to
attach callbacks for the resolution or rejection of the Deferred without
the ability to directly resolve or reject it.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)** The promise controlled by this Deferred instance.

#### resolve

Resolves the Deferred with the given value. If the value is a thenable
(i.e., has a "then" method), the Deferred will "follow" that thenable,
adopting its eventual state; otherwise, the Deferred will be fulfilled
with the value. This function behaves the same as Promise.resolve.

##### Parameters

*   `value` **any** The value to resolve the Deferred with.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)** A Promise that is resolved with the given value.

#### reject

Rejects the Deferred with the given reason. This function behaves the
same as Promise.reject. The Deferred will be rejected with the provided
reason.

##### Parameters

*   `reason` **any** The reason to reject the Deferred with.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)** A Promise that is rejected with the given reason.

#### species

A getter for the species symbol which returns a custom DeferredPromise
class. This class extends from Deferred and is used to ensure that the
constructor signature matches that of a Promise. The executor function
passed to the constructor of this class is used to initialize the Deferred
object with resolve and reject functions, similar to how a Promise would
be initialized.

Returns **DeferredPromise** A DeferredPromise class that extends Deferred.

### promise

The promise backing this deferred object. Created when the constructor
runs, this promise is what all `Promise.prototype` functions are routed
to.

Type: [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)

### reject

The reject() resolver that will be assigned when a new instance is
created. Invoking this function with or without a `reason` will cause
the deferred's promise to be settled.

Type: [function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)

### resolve

The resolve() resolver that will be assigned when a new instance is
created. Invoking this function with or without a `value` will cause
the deferred's promise to be settled.

Type: [function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)

### settled

When either [Deferred.resolve](Deferred.resolve) or [Deferred.reject](Deferred.reject) are called,
this property is set to `true`. Its current status at any time can be
queried using the [Deferred.settled](Deferred.settled) getter.

Type: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)

### secret

Sets the secret key used for signing and verifying JWT tokens.
This method allows for updating the secret key at runtime. The new secret
should be a string that is kept secure and not exposed to unauthorized
entities. It is critical to ensure that the secret key is valid and kept
confidential to maintain the integrity and security of the tokens being
processed.

#### Parameters

*   `value` **([string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) | [function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function))** The new secret key to be used for JWT
    operations.

### secretSet

Getter for the private static member #secretSet. This property indicates
whether the JWT secret has been set for the JWTExtension class. It is
primarily used to check if the secret key is available before performing
JWT operations. This getter ensures encapsulation by preventing direct
access to the private static member.

Returns **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** True if the secret is set, false otherwise.

### init

Initializes the JWTExtension with a given secret key. This method is used
to set the secret key for JWT operations at the start of the application.
The secret key is essential for the encoding and decoding of the tokens,
ensuring their integrity and security. The method returns the class itself,
allowing for method chaining.

#### Parameters

*   `secret` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The secret key used for signing and verifying JWT
    tokens. It should be a string that is kept secure and not exposed to
    unauthorized entities.

Returns **JWTExtension** The JWTExtension class for method chaining.

### sign

Signs a payload to create a JSON Web Token (JWT). This method can be used
synchronously or asynchronously, depending on whether a callback is
provided. If a callback is provided, the method returns a promise and the
callback is called with the error or the signed token. If no callback is
provided, the token is signed synchronously and returned.

Before signing, the method checks if the secret key has been set. If not,
it throws an error to prevent the creation of an unsigned token.

#### Parameters

*   `payload` **([Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) | [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String))** The data to be signed into the token.
*   `durationOrOptions` **([Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) | [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) | [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number))?** Either the duration
    for which the token is valid, or an options object. If an object is
    provided, it should conform to the options that the underlying jsonwebtoken
    library accepts.
*   `callback` **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)?** Optional callback for Node.js style
    asynchronous operation. Called with an error or the signed token.

<!---->

*   Throws **[Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error)** If the secret key has not been set before calling this
    method.

Returns **([Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) | [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String))** If a callback is provided, a promise is
returned that resolves with the signed token or rejects with an error. If
no callback is provided, the signed token is returned synchronously.

### decode

Decodes or verifies a JSON Web Token (JWT) using a secret key. This method
can operate synchronously or asynchronously, depending on whether a
callback function is provided. If a callback is provided or `true` is
passed, the method returns a promise and the callback is called with the
error or the decoded token. If no callback is provided, the token is
verified synchronously and the decoded token is returned.

#### Parameters

*   `token` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The JWT to decode or verify.
*   `options` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)?** Optional settings for token verification, such
    as `secret` to override the default, `algorithms` to specify the expected
    signing algorithm, `issuer` to check the issuer, `audience` to check the
    audience, and others. If `decode` is set to `true` in options and `raw` is
    true, the token is decoded without verification.
*   `callback` **([Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function) | [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean))?** Optional callback for Node.js style
    asynchronous operation, or `true` to return a promise without using a
    callback. Called with an error or the decoded token.

<!---->

*   Throws **[Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error)** If the secret key has not been set before calling this
    method.

Returns **([Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) | [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) | [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String))** If a callback is provided or `true` is
passed, a promise is returned that resolves with the decoded token or
rejects with an error. If no callback is provided, the decoded token is
returned synchronously.

### Range

Represents a numerical range with a start, end, and step value. The range
can be inclusive or exclusive of the end value. It can be iterated over
and can check if a value is included within the range. The start, end, and
step can be static values or functions that return the respective values.
The step value must be non-zero. The range can be used in for...of loops
and other iterable contexts.

#### Parameters

*   `start` **([object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) | [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number))** An object containing all properties, or
    the starting value of the range. If an object is provided, other
    parameters are ignored.
*   `end` **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)?** The ending value of the range. Required if `start`
    is a number.
*   `step` **([number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number) | [function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function))** The step value between each value in
    the range, or a function that returns the step value. Must be a non-zero
    number or function returning a non-zero number. (optional, default `1`)
*   `inclusive` **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** Determines whether the range includes
    the end value. (optional, default `true`)

#### Examples

```javascript
// Create an inclusive range from 1 to 5 with a step of 1
const range = new Range(1, 5);
for (const value of range) {
  console.log(value); // Logs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
}
```

```javascript
// Create an exclusive range from 10 to 20 with a step of 2
const exclusiveRange = new Range({
  start: 10, end: 20, step: 2, inclusive: false
});
for (const value of exclusiveRange) {
  console.log(value); // Logs 10, 12, 14, 16, 18
}
```

#### inclusive

Determines whether the range includes the end value. When set to `true`,
the range will include the end value in its set of values. When set to
`false`, the end value is not included. This property is `true` by
default, meaning ranges are inclusive of the end value unless
explicitly set otherwise.

Type: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)

#### start

Retrieves the starting value of the range. If the starting value is a
function, it invokes the function and returns its result. Otherwise, it
returns the starting value directly.

Returns **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** The starting value of the range or the result of the
starting value function.

#### start

Sets the starting value of the range. This value can be a number or a
function that returns a number. If a function is provided, it will be
invoked to determine the starting value each time the `start` property
is accessed.

##### Parameters

*   `value` **([number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number) | [function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function))** The new starting value or a function
    that returns the starting value.

#### end

Retrieves the ending value of the range. If the ending value is a function,
it invokes the function and returns its result. Otherwise, it returns the
ending value directly.

Returns **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** The ending value of the range or the result of the ending
value function.

#### end

Sets the ending value of the range. This value can be a number or a
function that returns a number. If a function is provided, it will be
invoked to determine the ending value each time the `end` property
is accessed.

##### Parameters

*   `value` **([number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number) | [function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function))** The new ending value or a function
    that returns the ending value.

#### step

Retrieves the step value of the range. If the step value is a function,
it invokes the function and returns its result. Otherwise, it returns the
step value directly. This value determines the increment between each
number in the range.

Returns **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** The step value of the range or the result of the step
value function.

#### step

Sets the step value of the range. The step value determines the increment
between each number in the range. It can be a non-zero number or a function
that returns a non-zero number. If the provided value is zero, not a number,
or a function that returns zero or not a number, an error is thrown.

##### Parameters

*   `value` **([number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number) | [function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function))** The new step value or a function that
    returns the step value. Must not be zero or return zero.

<!---->

*   Throws **[Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error)** If the value is zero, not a number, or a function that
    returns zero or not a number.

#### size

Retrieves the size of the range, which is the number of steps from the
start value to the end value. If the end value is undefined, it returns
the number of steps from the start value to zero. The size is always
rounded down to the nearest whole number when the end value is defined,
and rounded to the nearest whole number in general when the end value
is undefined.

Returns **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** The size of the range, representing the count of
discrete steps within the range.

#### each

Iterates over the range, executing a callback for each value in the range.
The iteration order is from the start value to the end value, inclusive or
exclusive based on the 'inclusive' property. If 'inclusive' is true, the
end value is included in the iteration; otherwise, it is excluded. The
iteration step is determined by the 'step' property. If the start value is
less than the end value, the iteration is in ascending order; if the start
value is greater than the end value, the iteration is in descending order.

##### Parameters

*   `callback` **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** The function to execute for each value in the
    range. It receives the current value as an argument.

#### includes

Determines whether a given value is included in the range. If the range's
end value is not a number (NaN), it checks if the start value is equal to
the given value. If the end value is a number, it checks if the given value
is between the start and end values, and if the difference between the start
value and the given value is an exact multiple of the step value. This
method takes into account whether the range is inclusive of the end value.

##### Parameters

*   `val` **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** The value to check for inclusion in the range.

Returns **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** True if the value is included in the range, false
otherwise.

#### iterator

Creates an iterator that yields each value in the range according to the
start, end, and step properties. The iterator can be used in for...of loops
and other constructs that consume iterables. If the range is inclusive, the
end value is yielded; otherwise, it is not. The iteration respects the
direction of the range, ascending or descending, based on the start and end
values.

### Singleton

The Singleton class is a design pattern that ensures only one instance of a
class is created and provides a way to access that instance.

#### \_\_instanceMap

Static map of all instances of the Singleton. Any class that extends Singleton
and has its `shared` property retrieved will be stored here with the class
as the key and the single shared instance as the value.

#### shared

The function returns a shared instance of a class, creating a new instance if
one does not already exist.

Returns **any** The shared instance of the Singleton class.

#### species

The above function returns the constructor function of the current object.
This is crucial to allow other classes that are to extend from Singleton to
have their

Returns **any** The `this` keyword is being returned.

### trimLeading

Creates a template function for processing string literals with embedded
expressions. This function can optionally trim leading whitespace from each
line of the string based on the indentation of the first non-empty line.

#### Parameters

*   `applyIndent`   (optional, default `0`)
*   `metadata`   (optional, default `undefined`)
*   `trimLeading` **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** When true, trims the leading whitespace
    from each line of the string to match the indentation of the first non-empty
    line. When false, it leaves the string as-is. (optional, default `true`)

#### Examples

```javascript
// Usage with template literal:
const trim = trimLeading();
const result = trim`
  Line 1
  Line 2
  Line 3
`;
// result is "Line 1\n Line 2\nLine 3"
```

Returns **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** A template function that takes a template literal and
its embedded expressions as arguments. The function processes the template
literal, optionally trims leading whitespace, and returns the resulting
string.

### Hasher

A simple Hasher implementation in JavaScript. This mimics the behavior of Swift's
Hasher to some extent. It uses the djb2 algorithm for hashing.

#### Parameters

*   `values` **...any** The "values" parameter is a rest parameter that allows you to
    pass in multiple arguments to the constructor. It can accept any number of
    arguments, and each argument can be of any type. The arguments are passed as
    an array-like object called "arguments" within the constructor function.

#### add

Adds the given value into the hasher.

##### Parameters

*   `values` **...any**&#x20;
*   `value` **([number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number) | [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String))** The value to hash. If the value is not a number
    nor a string, then it will be converted into a string

#### hash

The function returns the absolute value of a hash code as a base-36 string.

Returns **any** The method is returning the absolute value of the private property
`hash` converted to a base-36 string.

#### reset

The function "reset" sets the value of the private property "hash" to 5381.

#### seed

The above function returns the value of the private variable "seed".

Returns **any** The seed value of the object.

#### seed

The above function sets the value of the seed property.

##### Parameters

*   `newValue`  newValue is the new value that will be assigned to the seed
    property.

#### toKeys

The function "toKeys" converts the keys of an object into an array of strings.

##### Parameters

*   `object`  The `object` parameter is the object for which we want to get
    the keys.

Returns **any** an array of strings that represent the keys of the input object.

#### hasSymbols

The function "hasSymbols" checks if an array contains any symbols and
returns true if it does, false otherwise.

##### Parameters

*   `array`  The parameter "array" is expected to be an array.

Returns **any** a boolean value. It returns true if the input array contains at
least one symbol, and false otherwise.

### SemVer

Represents a semantic version (semver) and provides utility methods for
managing and comparing versions according to the semver specification.

#### Parameters

*   `semverString` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The initial semantic version string. (optional, default `"0.0.0"`)
*   `part` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** by default this is set to `*` which indicates that
    the entire `semverString` is to be parsed. If the `part` is the name of a property
    matching one of \[`major`, `minor`, `patch`, `prerelease` or `metadata`] then
    only that portion of the version is set. For major, minor and patch, the value
    will be parsed into an integer. If an unknown key is specified, the entire
    string will be processed. (optional, default `"*"`)

#### set

Sets the version based on a semver string. This method parses the string
and updates the major, minor, patch, prerelease, and metadata parts of the
version accordingly.

##### Parameters

*   `semverString` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The semver string to parse and set.
*   `part`   (optional, default `'*'`)

<!---->

*   Throws **[Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error)** If semverString is not a string or not in valid semver format.

#### get

Retrieves the full version string in semver format. Constructs the version
string including the major, minor, patch versions, and optionally the
prerelease and metadata parts if they are present.

Returns **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The full version string in semver format.

#### increment

Increments part of the SemVer instance by the indicated amount.

##### Parameters

*   `version` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** the portion of the version to increment. Valid values
    are `major`, `minor` or `patch`.
*   `by` **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** the amount by which the version is incremented. This
    defaults to 1. (optional, default `1`)

Returns **[SemVer](#semver)** the `this` instance for further chaining

#### decrement

Decrements part of the SemVer instance by the indicated amount.

##### Parameters

*   `version` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** the portion of the version to decrement. Valid values
    are `major`, `minor` or `patch`.
*   `by` **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** the amount by which the version is decremented. This
    defaults to 1. (optional, default `1`)

Returns **[SemVer](#semver)** the `this` instance for further chaining

#### toPrimitive

Converts the version to a primitive value based on the context. When
converting to a number, only the major and minor parts are considered.
When converting to a string, the full semver string is returned.

##### Parameters

*   `hint` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The context in which conversion is requested ("number"
    or "string").

Returns **([string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) | [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number) | null)** The converted value.

#### isEqual

Determines if this version is exactly equal to another version. This
comparison includes the major, minor, patch, prerelease, and metadata
parts of the version. It's a strict comparison where all parts must match.

##### Parameters

*   `otherVersion` **[SemVer](#semver)** The other SemVer instance to compare with.

Returns **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** True if all version components are exactly equal.

#### isLooselyEqual

Checks if this version is equal to another version based only on the major,
minor, and patch numbers. This method ignores the prerelease and metadata
parts of the version, making it a "loose" or "lenient" comparison. It is
useful for determining compatibility or disregarding build and pre-release
details.

##### Parameters

*   `otherVersion` **[SemVer](#semver)** The other SemVer instance to compare with.

Returns **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** True if major, minor, and patch numbers are equal.

#### isSemverEqual

Compares this version to another version according to semver equality
rules. In semver, two versions are considered equal if they have the same
major, minor, and patch numbers. This method also considers prerelease
tags but ignores build metadata. For example, "1.0.0-alpha" and
"1.0.0-alpha+build" are considered equal.

##### Parameters

*   `otherVersion` **[SemVer](#semver)** The other SemVer instance to compare with.

Returns **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** True if versions are considered equal in semver terms.

#### toStringTag

Provides a custom tag when the object is converted to a string. This
method overrides the default behavior to return the class name instead
of the generic "Object" tag.

Returns **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The class name "SemVer".

#### major

The primary version number for this SemVer instance. This version of the
instance, when bumped, indicates likely breaking changes or at least a
semmantic separation from previous major revisions

Type: [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)

#### minor

The minor version number for this SemVer instance. This version of the instance,
when bumped, usually indicates that new features are present. It is expected,
however, that minor bump versions are backwards compatible.

Type: [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)

#### patch

The patch version number for this SemVer instance. This version of the instance,
when bumped, usually indicates that some fix has been applied but that there are
no new features or breaking changes. These should usually be taken greedily.

#### prerelease

This is prerelease string indicator. Usually this has a value like "alpha" or
"beta". A SemVer value with a prerelease indicator might look like "1.0.0-beta"
indicating, in this example, that it is a beta release for 1.0.0.

Type: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)

#### metadata

The metadata string portion of a SemVer version is a note to the consumer but
may not have any real bearing on changes. This is a human readable version. A
metadata portion may show up in a SemVer string as "1.0.0-beta+001". In this
case maybe providing an iteration value. It can be any string. It is only usually
compared in version comparisons, in the strictest compares.

Type: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)

#### FULL

The `FULL` constant can be passed as a second parameter, inspite of it being
the default value, to the `.set()` method on `SemVer` instances. It indicates
that the full SemVer string should be parsed and set.

Type: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)

#### MAJOR

The `MAJOR` constant can be used as a parameter to `set()`, `increment()`,
and `decrement()` methods. It points to the major semver version number.

Type: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)

##### Examples

```javascript
semver.increment(SemVer.MAJOR).get()
```

#### MINOR

The `MINOR` constant can be used as a parameter to `set()`, `increment()`,
and `decrement()` methods. It points to the minor semver version number.

Type: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)

##### Examples

```javascript
semver.increment(SemVer.MINOR).get()
```

#### PATCH

The `PATCH` constant can be used as a parameter to `set()`, `increment()`,
and `decrement()` methods. It points to the patch semver version number.

Type: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)

##### Examples

```javascript
semver.increment(SemVer.PATCH).get()
```

#### PRERELEASE

The `PRERELEASE` constant can be used as a parameter to `set()` method. It
points to the pre-release semver version text.

Type: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)

##### Examples

```javascript
semver.set("beta", SemVer.PRERELEASE).get()
```

#### METADATA

The `METADATA` constant can be used as a parameter to `set()` method. It
points to the metadata semver version text.

Type: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)

##### Examples

```javascript
semver.set("bries_release", SemVer.METADATA).get()
```

#### compare

Compares two semver strings for semver equality. This static method allows
for a direct comparison without needing to create SemVer instances
externally. It is useful for quick comparisons where instantiation of
objects is not necessary.

##### Parameters

*   `leftVersion` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The first version string to compare.
*   `rightVersion` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The second version string to compare.

Returns **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** True if the versions are semver equal according to
the isSemverEqual method.
